### Imported LuaU Useful Modules for Roblox 

How to use, you may ask?
To use those base functions you need to set up things.

First of all, Read the tutorial in the example folder. 

Secondly, Create a Chat3 [RemoteEvent](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/RemoteEvent) in [ReplicatedStorage](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ReplicatedStorage). 


And that's it. The **setStarterSpawnLocation** function works in when you have a SpawnLocation in Workspace. Reminder.


!! OLD CODE DO NOT USE, IF NEEDED !!
